# 🚗 Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

This project implements a **Dynamic Pricing System** for urban parking spaces. The goal is to adjust parking prices in real-time based on demand, traffic, special events, and competition from nearby parking lots.  

✅ **Capstone Project - Summer Analytics 2025**  
✅ Developed using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Pathway, and Bokeh**  
✅ Google Colab Notebook with step-by-step explanation and interactive visualizations.

## 📂 Project Overview

### 📌 Problem Statement
Urban parking spaces are often overcrowded or underutilized due to static pricing. This project builds a **data-driven pricing engine** that dynamically adjusts prices to optimize space utilization and improve revenue.

---

## 📊 Models Implemented
1. **Baseline Linear Model**
   - Adjusts prices proportionally to occupancy.
2. **Demand-Based Model**
   - Considers occupancy, traffic, queue length, vehicle type, and special days.
3. **Competitive Pricing Model**
   - Adds location intelligence and competitor price awareness.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time price updates using **Pathway**.
- Interactive visualizations with **Bokeh**.
- Smooth and explainable price changes.
